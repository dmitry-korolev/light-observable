## Features
* **Standard**: fully compatible with the [Observable Proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-observable).
* **Tiny**: Observable itself is ~[1 kilobyte in gzip](.size-limit.js) (including [symbol-observable](https://github.com/benlesh/symbol-observable) package).
* **Type-safe**: written in typescript.
* **Reliable**: 100% code coverage.
* **Moderate**: only standard methods are included to the Observable and Observable prototype + special `Observable.prototype.pipe` method that allows usage of pipeable operators.

## Installation
```bash
npm install light-observable
```

## Usage
```js
import { Observable } from 'light-observable'

const o = new Observable(observer => {
  observer.next(1)
  observer.next(2)
  observer.complete()
})

o.subscribe(console.log)
// > 1
// > 2
```

## Extras
#### `Observable.prototype.pipe`
`light-observable` has a special `pipe` method, which is similar to any other pipe implementation. It applies provided functions from left to right. It allows usage of any function, including pipeable RxJS operators (although you **have to** pass RxJS `from` method first). This is the only non-standard method in `light-observable` Observable implementation.
```js
import { of } from 'light-observable/observable'
import { from } from 'rxjs'
import { filter, map } from 'rxjs/operators'

of(1, 2, 3, 4)
    .pipe(
      from,
      filter(x => x > 2),
      map(x => x * 2)
    )
    .subscribe(console.log)

// => 6, 8
```

## Motivation
Because sometimes you just don't need all these tons of classes, dozens of schedulers and countless operators. Only some of them. Someday.

## Notice on interoperability
RxJS 6 doesn't use 'symbol-observable' polyfill. This may cause some weird issues with interop depending on the import order. It is recommended to install and import `symbol-observable` polyfill before RxJS.

See the [issue](https://github.com/benlesh/symbol-observable/issues/38) for details.
