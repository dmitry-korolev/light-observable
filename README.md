An implementation of Observables for JavaScript. Requires a Promise polyfill.

This is a fork of [zen-observable](https://github.com/zenparsing/zen-observable).

## Features:
* **Standard**: fully compatible with the [Observable Proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-observable).
* **Tiny**: only 829 bytes in gzip.
* **Type-safe**: written in typescript.
* **Reliable**: 100% code coverage.
* **Moderate**: only standard methods are included.

## Install
```bash
npm install light-observable
```

## Why
Because sometimes you just don't need all these tons of classes, dozens of schedulers and countless operators.
